<h3>Scene One&mdash;The Throne Room.</h3>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">FIRST SERVANT.</p>

<p>(<i>Leaning out of the window.</i>) They are coming! It will
overtake us like the day of judgment!</p>

<p class="char">SECOND SERVANT.</p>

<p>(Rushing in through the opposite door.) Do you know that
the King is taken?</p>

<p class="char">FIRST SERVANT.</p>

<p>Our King a captive?</p>

<p class="char">SECOND SERVANT.</p>

<p>Since early yesterday! The dogs have thrown him into prison!</p>

<p class="char">FIRST SERVANT.</p>

<p>Then we had better scamper away, or they will treat us
as if we were the beds upon which he has debauched their
children!</p>

<p>(<i>The servants rush out. The room becomes filled with armed
workmen of various trades, heated and blood-splashed from
combat.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">PIETRO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>(<i>Steps from their midst</i>.) Fellow-citizens!&mdash;The byways
of Perugia are strewn with the corpses of our children and
our brothers. Many of you have a pious wish to give your
beloved dead a fitting resting place.&mdash;Fellow-citizens!
First we must fulfill a higher duty. Let us do our part as
quickly as possible, so that the dead shall have perished,
not solely for their bravery, but for the lasting welfare
of their native-land! Let us seize the moment! Let us give
our state a constitution which, in future, will protect
her children from the assassin's weapons and insure her
citizens the just reward of their labors!</p>

<p class="char">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Long live Pietro Folchi!</p>

<p class="char">ANDREA VALORI.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens! Unless we decide at once upon our future
form of government, we shall only be holding this dearly
captured place for our enemies until we lose it again.
We are holding the former King in custody in prison; the
patricians, who supported themselves in idleness by the
sweat of our brows, are in flight toward neighboring
states. Now, I ask you, fellow-citizens, shall we proclaim
our state the Umbrian Republic, as has been done in
Florence, in Parma, and in Siena?</p>

<p class="char">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Long live Freedom! Long live Perugia! Long live the Umbrian
Republic!</p>

<p class="char">PIETRO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>Let us proceed without delay to elect a podesta! Here are
tables and styles in plenty. Let each one write the name of
the man whom he considers best fitted to guide the destiny
of the state and to defend the power we have gained from
our enemies.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Long live our podesta, Pietro Folchi! Long live the
Republic of Perugia!</p>

<p class="char">ANDREA VALORI.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens! Let there be no precipitate haste at this
hour! It is necessary to strengthen so the power we have
won that they cannot prevail against us as long as we live.
Would we succeed if we made Umbria a republic? Under the
shelter of republican liberty, the sons of the banished
nobles would use the vanity of our daughters to bind us
again in chains while we slept unsuspectingly at night!
Look at Florence! Look at Siena! Is not liberty in those
states only the cloak of the most dissolute despotism,
which is turning their citizens to beggars? Perugia grew
in power and prosperity under her kings, until the sceptre
passed into the hands of a fool and a wastrel. Let us raise
the worthiest of us up to his throne. Then we who stand
here exhausted from the conflict, will become the future
aristocracy and the lords of the land; only then can we
enjoy in lasting peace our hard won prerogatives.</p>

<p class="char">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Long live the king! Long live Pietro Folchi!</p>

<p class="char">A FEW VOICES.</p>

<p>Long live Freedom!</p>

<p class="char">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>(Louder.) Long live our king, Pietro Folchi! Long live King
Pietro!</p>

<p class="char">A FEW CITIZENS.</p>

<p>(<i>Leaving the room angrily.</i>) We did not shed our blood for
this. Down with slavery! Long live Freedom!</p>

<p class="char">THE CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Hurrah for King Pietro!</p>

<p class="char">PIETRO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>(<i>Mounting the throne.</i>) Called to it by your choice, I
mount this throne and name myself King of Umbria! The
dissatisfied who have separated from our midst with the cry
of "freedom" are no less our enemies than the idle nobles
who have turned their backs to our walls. I shall keep a
watchful eye on them, as they fought on our side only in
the hope of plundering in the ruins of our beloved city.
Where is my son Filipo?</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>(<i>Stepping from out the press.</i>) What is your will, my
father?</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>From the wounds above your eyes, I see that you did not
shun death yesterday or today! I name you commander of our
war forces. Post our loyal soldiers at the ten gates of
the city, and order the drum to beat in the market place
for recruits. Perugia must be armed for an expedition to
its frontiers in the shortest possible time. You will
be answerable to me for the life of every citizen and
responsible for the inviolate safety of all property. Now
bring the former king of Umbria forth from his prison. It
is proper that none save I announce to him his sentence.</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Your commands shall be observed punctually. Long live King
Pietro! (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Where is my son-in-law, Andrea Valori?</p>

<p class="char">ANDREA VALORI.</p>

<p>(<i>Stepping forward.</i>) Here, my king, at your command!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>I name you treasurer of the Kingdom of Umbria. You and
my cousin, Giullio Diaceto, together with our celebrated
jurist, Bernardo Ruccellai, whose persuasive words abroad
have more than once preserved our city from bloodshed; you
three shall be my advisors in the discharge of affairs of
state. (<i>After the three summoned have come forward.</i>) Seat
yourselves beside me. (<i>They do so.</i>) I can only fulfill
the high duty of ruling others if the most able men in
the state will enlist their lives in my service. And now,
let the others go to bury the victims of this two days'
conflict. To show that they did not die in vain for the
welfare of their brothers and children, let this be a day
of mourning and earnest vigilance.</p>

<p>(<i>All leave the room save King Pietro, the Councillors and
several guards. Then the captive King is led in by Filipo
Folchi and several armed men.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Who is bold enough to dare bring us here at the bidding of
these disloyal knaves?!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>According to the provision of our laws, the royal power
in Umbria fell to you as eldest son of King Giovanni. You
have used your power to degrade the name of a king with
roisterers and courtesans. You chose banquets, masquerades
and hunting parties, by which you have dissipated the
treasures of the state and made the country poor and
defenseless, in preference to every princely duty. You
have robbed us of our daughters, and your deeds have been
the most corrupting example to our sons. You have lived
as little for the state's welfare as for your own. You
accomplished only the downfall of your own and our native
land.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>To whom is the butcher speaking?</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>Silence!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Give me back my sword!</p>

<p class="char">ANDREA VALORI.</p>

<p>Put him in chains! He is raving!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Let the butcher speak further.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Your life is forfeited and lies in my hands. But I will
suspend sentence of death if in legal document you will
relinquish in my favor, and in favor of my heirs, your
claim and that of your kin to the throne, and acknowledge
me as your lord, your rightful successor and as the ruler
of Umbria.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Laughs boisterously.</i>) Ha, ha, ha! Ask of a carp lying
in the pan to cease to be a fish! That this worm has our
life in his power proves indeed that princes are not gods,
because, like other men, they are mortal. The lightning,
too, can kill; but he who is born a king does not die like
an ordinary mortal! Let one of these artisans lay hands
upon us, if his blood does not first chill in his veins.
Then he shall see how a king dies!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>You are a greater enemy to yourself than your deadliest
foes can possibly be. Although you will not abdicate, we
will be mild, in thankful remembrance of the blessed rule
of King Giovanni, whose own son you are, and banish you now
and forever from the confines of the Umbrian States, under
penalty of death.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Banish! Ha, ha, ha! Who in the world will banish the King!
Shall fear of death keep him from the land of which Heaven
appointed him the ruler? Only an artisan could hold life so
dear and a crown so cheap!&mdash;&mdash;Ha, ha, ha! These pitiable
fools seem to imagine that when a crown is placed upon a
butcher he becomes a king! See how the paunch-belly grows
pale and shivers up there, like a cheese flung against
the wall! Ha, ha, ha! How they stare at us, the stupid
blockheads, with their moist dogs' eyes, as if the sun had
fallen at their feet!</p>

<p class="char">PRINCESS ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushes in, breaking through the guards at the door. She
is fifteen years old, is clad in rich but torn garments
and her hair is disheveled.</i>) Let me pass! Let me go to my
father! Where is my father? (<i>Sinking down before the King
and embracing his knees.</i>) Father! Have I you again, my
dearly beloved father?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Raising her.</i>) So I hold you unharmed in my arms once
more, my dearest treasure! Why must you come to me with
your heartrending grief just at this moment when I had
almost stamped these bloodthirsty hounds beneath my feet
again!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Then let me die with you! To share death with you would be
the greatest happiness, after what I have lived through in
the streets of Perugia these last two days! They would not
let me come to you in prison, but now you are mine again!
Remember, my father, I have no one else in the world but
you!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>My child, my dear child, why do you compel me to confess
before my murderers how weak I am! Go! I have brought my
fate upon myself, let me bear it alone. These men will
confirm it that you may expect more compassion and better
fortune from my bitterest enemies than if you cling now to
your father, broken by fate.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>With greatest intensity.</i>) No, do not say that! I beseech
you do not speak so again! (<i>Caressingly.</i>) Only remember
that it is not yet decided that they murder us. And if we
had rather die together than be parted who in the world can
harm us then!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>Who during this scene has quietly come to an agreement
with his councillors, turning to the King.</i>) The city of
Perugia will give your daughter the most careful education
until her majority; and then bestow upon her a princely
dower; if she will promise to give her hand in marriage to
my son, Filipo Folchi, who will be my successor upon this
throne.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>You have heard, my child? The throne of your father is open
to you!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>O my God, how can you so scoff at your poor child!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>To the King.</i>) As for you, armed men under the command of
my son shall conduct you, within this hour, to the confines
of this country. Have a care that you do not take so much
as a step within our land hereafter, or your head shall
fall by the hand of the executioner in the market place of
Perugia!</p>

<p>(<i>Filipo Folchi has the King and the Princess, clinging
close to her father, led off by men-at-arms. He is about to
follow them, when his arm is seized by Benedetto Nardi, who
rushes in breathless with rage.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">BENEDETTO NARDI.</p>

<p>Have I caught you, scoundrel! (<i>To King Pietro.</i>) This
son of yours, Pietro Folchi, in company with his drunken
comrades, chased my helpless child through the streets of
the city yesterday evening, and was about to lay hands on
her when two of my journeymen, attracted by her cries, put
the scoundrels to flight with their clubs. The wretch still
carries the bloody mark above his eyes!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>In anger.</i>) Defend yourself, my son!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO FOLCHI.</p>

<p>He speaks the truth.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Back to the shop with you! Must I see my rule disgraced on
its first day by my own son in most impious fashion! The
law shall work its greatest hardship upon you! Afterward
you shall stay in the butcher shop until the citizens of
Perugia kneel before me and beg me to have pity on you! Put
him in chains!</p>

<p>(<i>The mercenaries who led out the King return with Alma.
Their leader throws himself on his knees before the
throne.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE MERCENARY.</p>

<p>O Sire, do not punish your servants for this frightful
misfortune! As we were leading the King just here before
the portal across the bridge of San Margherita, a company
of our comrades marched past and pressed us against the
coping. The prisoner seized that opportunity to leap into
the flood swollen by the rain. We needed all our strength
to prevent this maiden from doing likewise, and when I was
about to leap after the prisoner, the raging waves had long
engulfed him.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>His life is not the most regrettable sacrifice of these
bloody days! Hundreds of better men have fallen for
him. (<i>To the Councillors.</i>) Let the child be taken to
the Urseline nuns and kept under most careful guard.
(<i>Rising.</i>) The sitting of the counsel is closed.</p>

<p class="char">ALL PRESENT.</p>

<p>Long live King Pietro!</p>

<h3>Scene Two</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><i>A highway along the edge of a forest.</i></p>

<p class="center">(<i>The King and Princess Alma, both clad as beggars.</i>)</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>How long have I been dragging you from place to place while
you begged for me?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Rest yourself, Father; you will be in better spirits
afterward.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Sits down by the wayside.</i>) Why did not the raging waves
swallow me that evening! Then everything would have been
over long ago!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Did you leap over the side of the bridge to put an end to
your life? I thought what strength resided in your arms and
that the rushing waters would help you to liberty. Without
this faith how should I have had the courage to escape from
the convent and from the city?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Below us here lies the rich hunting grounds where I have
often ridden hawking with my court. You were too young to
accompany us.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Why will you not leave this little land of Umbria, my
father! The world is so large! In Siena, in Modena, your
friends dwell. They would welcome you with joy, and at last
your dear head would be safe.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>You offer me much, my child! Still, I beg of you not to
keep repeating this question. Just in this lies my fate:
If I were able to leave this land, I should not have lost
my crown. But my soul is ruled by desires which I cannot
relinquish, even to save my life. As king, I believed
myself safe enough from the world to live my dreams without
danger. I forgot that the king, the peasant and every other
man, must live only to preserve his station and to defend
his estate, unless he would lose both.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Now you are scoffing at yourself, my father!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>That is the way of the world!&mdash;&mdash;You think I am scoffing at
myself?&mdash;&mdash;That, at least, might be something for which men
would contribute to our support. As I offer myself to them
now I am of no use. Either I offend them by my arrogance
and pride, which are in ridiculous contrast to my beggar's
rags, or my courteous demeanor makes them mistrustful, as
none of them succeeds by simple modesty. How my spirit has
debased itself during these six months, in order to fit
itself to their ways and methods! But everything I learned
as hereditary prince of Umbria is valueless in their world,
and everything which is of worth in their world I did not
learn as a prince. But if I succeed in jesting at my past,
my child, who knows but what we may find again a place at a
richly decked table! When the pork butcher is raised to the
throne there remains no calling for the king save that of
court fool.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Do not enrage yourself so in your fatigue, my father. See,
you must take a little nap! I will look for fresh water to
quench your thirst and cool your fevered brow.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Laying down his head.</i>) Thank you, my child.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing him.</i>) My dear father! (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Rises.</i>) How I have grown to love this beautiful land
since I have slunk about it at the risk of my life!
&mdash;&mdash;Even the worst disaster always brings good with it. Had
I not cared so little for my brave people of Perugia and
Umbria, had I not shown myself to them only at carnivals
and in fancy dress, God knows, but I might have been
recognized long ago! Here comes one of them now!</p>

<p>(<i>A landed proprietor comes up the road.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>God greet you, sir! Can you not give me work on your estate?</p>

<p class="char">THE LANDED PROPRIETOR.</p>

<p>You might find much to recompense your work on my estate,
but, thank God, my house is guarded by fierce wolf hounds.
And here, you see, I carry a hunting knife, which I can use
so well that I should not advise you to come a step nearer
me!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Sir, you have no guarantee from Heaven that you may not be
compelled at some time to beg for work in order not to go
hungry.</p>

<p class="char">THE LANDED PROPRIETOR.</p>

<p>Ha, ha, ha! He who works in order not to go hungry, he is
the right kind of worker for me! First comes work and then
the hunger. Let him who can live without work starve rather
today than tomorrow!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Sir, you must have had wiser teachers than I!</p>

<p class="char">THE LANDED PROPRIETOR.</p>

<p>I should hope so! What have you learned?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>The trade of war.</p>

<p class="char">THE LANDED PROPRIETOR.</p>

<p>Thank God, under the rule of King Pietro, whom Heaven long
preserve to us, there is little use for that in Umbria any
longer. City and country enjoy peace, and at last we live
in concord with neighboring states.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Sir, you will find me of use for any work on your estate.</p>

<p class="char">THE LANDED PROPRIETOR.</p>

<p>I will think over the matter. You appear a harmless fellow.
I am on my way to my nephew, who has a large house and
family at Todi. I am coming back this afternoon. Wait for
me here at this spot. Possibly I will take you with me
then. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>"Let him who can live without work starve." What old saws
this vermin cherished to endure his miserable existence!
And I?&mdash;&mdash;I cannot even feed my child! A lordship was given
me by Heaven such as only one in a million can have! And
I cannot even give my child food!&mdash;&mdash;My kind father made
every hour of the day a festival for me by means of joyous
companions, by the wisest, teachers, by a host of devoted
servants, and my child must shiver with cold and sleep
under the hedges by the highway! Have pity on her, O God,
and blot her love for miserable me out of her heart! Let
happen to me then whatever will, I will bear it lightly!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushes out of the bushes with her hair tumbling down.</i>)
Father! Jesu Maria! My father! Help!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Clasping her in his arms.</i>) What is it, child?</p>

<p class="char">A VAGABOND.</p>

<p>(<i>Who has followed the maiden, comes forward and stops.</i>)
Ah!&mdash;How could I know another had her!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushes upon him with uplifted stick.</i>) Hence, you dirty
dog!</p>

<p class="char">THE VAGABOND.</p>

<p>I a dirty dog! What are you, then?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Striking him.</i>) That am I!&mdash;And that!&mdash;And that!</p>

<p>(<i>The vagabond seeks refuge in flight.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Trembling in her father's arms.</i>) O Father, I was leaning
over the spring when that man sprang at me!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Breathing hard.</i>) Calm yourself, my child</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>My poor father! That I, instead of being able to help you,
must still need your help!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Today I shall take you back to Perugia. Will throw you at
King Pietro's feet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Oh, do not let me hear of that again! Can I leave you when
death threatens you daily?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>It would be better for you to wear man's clothes, instead
of a woman's dress, in the future. It is marvel enough that
Providence has protected you until today from the horrors
that threaten you in our wanderings! You will be safer in
man's clothes. A countryman just passed this way. When he
comes back he will take me with him and give me work on his
place.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Will you really seek again to put yourself in the service
of those so abyssmally beneath you?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>What are you saying, my child! Why are they below
me?&mdash;&mdash;Besides, it is not quite certain that he will find
me worthy of his work. If he asks me to go with him, then
follow us, so that I can turn my place under his roof over
to you at night.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>No, no! You must not suffer hardship on my account. Have I
deserved that of you?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Do you know, my child, that if I had not had you with
me, my treasure, as guardian angel, I should very
probably be hanging today on a high gallows for highway
robbery?&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He sits down again by the road-side.</i>) And
now, let us tarry here in patient expectation of the
all-powerful man whose return will decide whether our
desire to live in communion with mankind is to be fulfilled.</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>



<hr class="r5" />
<h3>Scene One.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center" style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE WORKSHOP OF A LADIES' TAILOR.</p>


<p class="center">(<i>The King, in journeyman's clothes, sits cross-legged on a
table,<br /> working on a woman's gown of rich material.<br /> Master
Pandolfo bustles into the room.</i>)</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>Early to work, Gigi! Early to work! Bravo, Gigi!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>The cock has crowed, Master!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>Now shake me the other fellows awake. One can work better
in company than alone, Gigi! (<i>Takes the dress out of
his hands.</i>) See here, Gigi! (<i>He tears the dress.</i>)
Rip! What's the use of early to bed and early to rise if
the stitches don't hold? And the button-holes, Gigi! Did
the rats help you with them? I worked for Her Majesty
Queen Amelia when her husband was still making mortadella
and salmi. Am I to lose her custom now because of your
botching? Hey, Gigi?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>If my work shames you, turn me out!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>How rude, Gigi! Do you think you are still tending pigs at
Baschi? Forty years on your back and nothing learned! Go
packing out of my house and see where you will find your
food, then, you vagabond!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Rises and collects the scraps.</i>) I'll take you at your
word, Master!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>What the devil, madcap; can't you take a joke? Can I show
more love toward my 'prentice than I do when I give him the
work which usually the master does? Since you have been
with me haven't I allowed you to cut all the garments?
The devil take me that I cannot catch the knack of your
cutting! But the ladies of Perugia say, "Master Pandolfo,
since the old apprentice has been working for you, your
work has a genteel cut." But what's the use of a genteel
cut if the young ladies tear the stitches out as they
dance? You'll never be a journeyman, Gigi, unless you learn
to sew. My dear, sweet Gigi, don't you see that I only want
what's best for you?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Good, Master Pandolfo, I'll stay with you if from now on,
in addition to my keep, you will pay me thirty soldi more a
week.</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>I'll promise you that, Gigi! As true as I stand here, I'll
promise you that!&mdash;&mdash;Thirty soldi you want?&mdash;&mdash;Yes, yes!
The gown for her Majesty, the Queen, must be ready sewed by
noon. Therefore, be industrious, Gigi! Always industrious!
(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The King dimes a long breath after Master Pandolfo leaves
the room, and then sits down to his work again. After a
while, Princess Alma puts her head in through the window.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Are you alone, Father?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Springing up joyfully.</i>) My treasure!</p>

<p>(<i>Alma vanishes and immediately after comes in through
the door. She is dressed as a boy in a dark, neat suit of
clothes.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>The master is upstairs with his morning dram, and the
journeymen are still asleep. The moments I have with you,
my child, indemnify my soul for the days of dull routine.
What affectionate conversations I hold with you, and how
lovingly and understandingly you answer me! Do not forsake
me! It is a new crime I commit in asking this of you; but
see, I am a weak man!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Things will soon be better with us now, Father. The old
notary, whose errand-boy I became two months ago, already
lets me copy all his documents. Next week he is going to
take me to court with him, in order that I may take down
the case instead of him.&mdash;&mdash;O my father, if only the death
sentence which, now that we are in Perugia again, places
you in greater danger than ever before, could be lifted
from your head!&mdash;&mdash;My feminine ignorance of politics
prevents me conjecturing whether they will raise you to
the throne again. But they should honor you as more than a
king. There must be something godlike about you when, in
spite of your degradation, you are able to fill one with
happiness as you do me! What a wealth of happiness you
would have to give if your fetters were removed. Thousands
then would contend for you, and you would no longer envy
any king the weight of his crown!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Do not talk further about me. I must wait in obscurity
until my hour is come.&mdash;&mdash;But you, my child, do you not
feel deadly unhappy under the burden of your work?&mdash;&mdash;Isn't
your master disagreeable when he needs someone upon whom to
vent his bad temper?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>But don't you see what good spirits I am in, Father? The
people I serve know how to value education and culture.
You, on the contrary, must live with a brood of men whose
daily habits must torment your soul, even without their
knowledge or desire. I see you grind your teeth at this or
that retort. I see how your throat contracts with disgust
at mealtimes. Oh, forgive my words! They are unmindful of
your smarting wounds.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Whimsically.</i>) Only think, my child, the result of these
unusual circumstances is that I am cherished by Master
Pandolfo as his most industrious worker. At Baschi, where
I tended cattle, I made a shed behind the stables my
sleeping place. I used to lie there every morning on my
back, following my dreams until the sun stood over me in
the zenith. That's the reason the farmer discharged me.
Here I sleep with three common fellows, and, therefore, am
the first to rise and the last to go to bed. Personally,
I do not sleep as well in the company of men as I do in
the company of beasts. I never dreamed such an industrious
worker was concealed within me! Work serves me as a kind of
refuge. And then the beautiful lines of the heavy velvet,
the sheen of the gold brocade! They refresh my soul and I
long for them as for a vivifying drink. And then Master
Pandolfo's insight discovered in me at once a gift which
astonishes me highly, and which, to be can-did, I could not
give up lightly. He found I was better able than any of his
workmen, better able than himself even, to cut the stuff
for the ladies' dresses so as to bring out the figure to
the best advantage. For example, that doublet you wear I
should have cut quite differently than did that miserable
botcher whose shears were not worthy to touch such splendid
cloth.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Oh, silence, Father! How can you jest so callously at your
unhappy fate!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Passionately.</i>) Do not mock me with flattery, my child!
Fate jests at me and not I at it!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Soothingly.</i>) Beloved father, you remain a king, no
matter what you must do in this world.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>In your loving heart, yes! And, therefore, your father,
with loving despotism, opposes your life's happiness by
crowding out of your heart that longing for a man which
must be awakening in you at your age. Your father's
egotistical folly has lost you rank and property, now it
deprives you of the highest rights of life&mdash;those which the
creatures of the wilderness share with mankind and which
may make existence in a hut, as well as on a throne, a gift
of the gods! What madness made me test my strength against
the flood of the San Margherita brook, instead of invading
Umbria by war, setting the city on fire at its four corners
and snatching the crown with my own hands from the glowing
ruins!&mdash;&mdash;But that was only the continuation of past folly!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Weeping.</i>) Heaven have mercy on my foolish soul! How was
it possible for me so to grieve you!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>In misfortune people hurt each other without knowledge or
desire, just as truly as in happiness each one brings joy
to the other unwittingly. Do not make him who is judged
suffer for it. You must go, my child; I hear the workmen
shouting and tramping about upstairs.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing him.</i>) Tomorrow morning early! (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The King takes up his work. Then the three journeymen
come in, and, sitting down on separate tables on the other
side of the room, prepare for work.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>Gigi, if you get up before cockcrow again I'll break your
nose the next night while you sleep. Then go to the women
and see if you can succeed with them!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>It would please you well to attack a sleeping man. But take
care of your own bones at it, or perhaps you might not rise
at all the next day!</p>

<p class="char">NOE.</p>

<p>Well said, Gigi! Tell us quickly more of your war-like
deeds, that we may be afraid of you.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I haven't time. If your ears itch for tales of heroic
deeds, tell how you stole the parson's geese at Bavagna.</p>

<p class="char">BATTISTA.</p>

<p>Our patron saint defend us! Usually, you are as tame and
sneaking as if your nail had never crushed a louse, and
today you would like to spit all three of us at once on
your needle.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Let me be in peace, then! A hollow tooth is hurting me.
That's the reason I left the sleeping room so early.</p>

<p class="char">NOE.</p>

<p>Tell the truth, Gigi! Wasn't the page here just now who
brings you the glowing love letters from the lady for whom
you cut the yellow silk dress?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Do I concern myself with your love letters?</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>You concern yourself with entirely different things! You
get up right after midnight to practice being a lickspittle
and a trimmer! You get the master to give you the
journeymen's work and divide the apprentice's work among
us! You are a pest in the house!</p>

<p class="char">BATTISTA.</p>

<p>Apprentice, bring us the morning soup!</p>

<p>(<i>The King leaves the workroom.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">NOE.</p>

<p>He's lacking in the upper story; I am sorry for him. He
must have been some sort of bootcleaner for a gentleman of
quality. That moved his brain out of place in his skull.</p>

<p class="char">BATTISTA.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a soldier who would let himself be kicked
about so by journeymen tailors?</p>

<p class="char">NOE.</p>

<p>My mother was a country girl; I tell that to anybody who
asks me; I don't act as if I had been bed servant to the
Holy Father!</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>I'll tell you why the lad is so stupid. Each of us has
knocked about the world, often with not enough to eat. But
if he opens his mouth out comes a stream of curses profane
enough to turn one's stomach. Earth is ashamed at having
brought forth such a monster; then Heaven is ashamed to
have let its light fall upon him; then Hell is ashamed that
it has not yet swallowed him! You will see!</p>

<p>(<i>The King returns with four wooden, spoons and a pot of
soup, which he sets before the journeymen.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>Get out, you beast! You can lick our spoons when we have
had enough!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Strives with himself, seeking to master his anger, then
strikes his brow.</i>) Oh, a curse upon this king who hinders
me from allowing myself to be thrashed by this rascal! Oh,
a curse upon the king who hinders me crushing this rascal,
whom I understand better than he understands me! Oh, a
curse upon the king who hinders me from being a man like
other men! Oh a triple curse upon the king!</p>

<p>(<i>The journeymen spring up in horror.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>Did you hear? He cursed the king! He cursed the king!</p>

<p class="char">BATTISTA AND NOE.</p>

<p>(<i>Together.</i>) He has cursed the king!</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>Seize him! Hold him fast!&mdash;&mdash;Master Pandolfo!&mdash;&mdash;Master
Pandolfo!&mdash;&mdash;Knock in his teeth!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing in.</i>) Get to work, lads! Why are you fighting so
early in the morning? Are you mad?</p>

<p class="char">THE JOURNEYMEN.</p>

<p>(<i>Holding the King by the arms.</i>) He has cursed the
king!&mdash;&mdash;"Curse the king!" he cried! "A triple curse upon
the king!"</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Submitting indifferently to force.</i>) A triple curse
upon the king! Then let the king's head fall under the
headsman's axe.</p>

<p class="char">THE JOURNEYMEN.</p>

<p>Listen to him, Master Pandolfo!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>To himself.</i>) My poor child!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>Bind his hands behind his back! Cursing our dear, good King
Pietro! "Let King Pietro's head fall under the headsman's
axe!" Bring ropes! Take the dog to court! This vagabond
will lose me by best customers! The head of King Pietro,
who pays his bills more promptly than any king before him!</p>

seat to the right; the counsel for the defense occupies a
similar seat to the left. Further forward, to the right,
is the clerk of the court, with Princess Alma as his

Forward, on the left, are halberdiers guarding the door to
the adjoining room. The back of the hall is filled with
spectators.</i>)</p></blockquote>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>I open the session in the name of his exalted Majesty, the
king.&mdash;&mdash;According to his request, I grant the privilege of
speaking first to the counsel for the prosecution, Signor
Silvio Andrevitti, Doctor of Canonical and Civil Law and
Attorney-General for the Crown.</p>

<p class="char">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.</p>

<p>Under the rule of our sublime and beloved King Pietro, it
has become the custom in our city of Perugia to permit
the citizen to be present in court during a trial, in
order to strengthen his confidence in the unshakable
incorruptibility of our judgments. In view of the offence
which is to be tried here today, I venture to suggest to
the court that the spectators here assembled be excluded
from our session, in order that they may be protected from
looking too deeply into the degradation of human nature.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>The well-considered suggestion of the honorable
Attorney-General shall be followed.</p>

<p>(<i>The halberdiers, with crossed pikes, force the spectators
quietly out of the hall.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>Our sublime King Pietro has made the wise and just
provision that any poor defendant, no matter what his
nationality, be supplied with an advocate at the cost of
the state. The worthy Signor Corrado Ezzelino, master
and doctor of both civil and canonical law, has declared
himself ready to serve in this capacity today. Now, I grant
the privilege of speaking, at his special request, to our
worthy clerk of the court, Signor Matteo Nerli.</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>Honorable and wise judges, a cramp which lames my right
hand, the result of long years of untiring industry in the
service of the law, does not permit me the honor of taking
down the minutes of to-day's session unassisted. By my side
you see my apprenticed clerk, a lad who has awakened my
affection, and who, despite his youth, has shown an unusual
love of the law. I ask that he be permitted to keep the
minutes, under the direction and supervision of his master.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>Your wish is granted, blaster Matteo. The witnesses who
were called for to-day's session have all appeared in
person. Conduct the defendant thither.</p>

<p>(<i>The halberdiers bring in the King from the neighboring
room. Princess Alma startles at sight of him, but collects
herself and arranges her writing materials.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>You call yourself Ludovicus and were employed formerly in
tending cattle at Baschi. You are accused of the <i>crimen
læsæ majestatis</i>, which was visited with severe penalties
in the imperishable code of our great predecessors, the
ancient Romans; the crime of injuring majesty, or, in other
words, the insult to the holy person of the king. Do you
acknowledge yourself guilty of this offence?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>(<i>To Alma.</i>) He said "yes." Write it down, my lad; write it
down accurately!</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>According to the unanimous testimony of four unprejudiced
witnesses, your words were, "A triple curse upon the king!
Let the king's head fall under the headsman's axe!"</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Those were my words.</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>"Those were my words!" Joseph and Mary, a blot! Lad, has
the devil gotten into you today?</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>What have you to advance in your own behalf?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="char">MICHELE.</p>

<p>He has nothing to advance! Did you hear? He has nothing to
advance!</p>

<p class="char">MASTER PANDOLFO.</p>

<p>He spat out his terrible curse in miserable revenge against
me! He wanted to bring my business and my whole family into
disrepute.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>Silence on the witness bench!&mdash;&mdash;Now, what have you to say
in your own defense?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Nothing.&mdash;&mdash;Next to the majesty of God, the majesty of
the king stands highest in this world. The majesty of God
suffers as little from human curses as the majesty of the
king. Can the majesty of God be dimmed by vulgar humanity
saying, "We believe in you no longer"? Can the majesty
of the king be dimmed by people saying, "We will obey no
longer"? Who would assert that as possible?&mdash;&mdash;God wandered
in lowly form upon this earth, and the rabble believed it
had put him to death. And so the rabble may believe it
has banished the king; he remains where he was. If they
call to him, "Let your head fall under the headsman's
axe," it does him no harm. Therefore, although next to
blaspheming against God, blaspheming against the king is
the most execrable crime&mdash;a crime of which my words have
made me guilty, as I acknowledge openly&mdash;&mdash;it appears
to me that the matter should be such an indifferent and
trifling affair to the king that he should not need to
revenge it. At the same time, it seems to me too frightful
for the rabble to presume to be able ever to atone for it.
The rabble, indeed, possesses no higher power than that
over life and death, and, indeed, cannot know whether the
miserable sinner would not welcome death, no matter how
painful, as a liberation from a thousand sorrows. These,
therefore, are the reasons why I hold that the judges
before whom I now stand can execute no punishment upon me
for my crime. (<i>General murmur of dissent.</i>) Now, let me,
wise and honorable judges, name the grounds which make
it your holy duty to judge me according to the greatest
severity of the law.</p>

<p class="char">NOE.</p>

<p>I told you the fellow was completely crazy!</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>(<i>To the witness bench.</i>) Silence! (<i>To the King.</i>) Speak
further.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>The majesty of the king, as I have proved commensurate
to human reason, can receive no injury from my words.
But, unfortunately, next to faith in the All-Goodness of
Providence, faith in the majesty of the king is the highest
and holiest possession of the common people. That which the
sons of earth have known since all time as eternal truths,
against which none, be he master or slave, sins unpunished,
that stands under God's holy protection. Everything which
they value, everything that affects their property and
the prosperity of their daily work, that they enjoy with
childish confidence in their king's protection. In their
king the common people recognize the likeness of their own
fortune, and who smirches this likeness robs them of the
courage to work and of peace by night. I am far more guilty
of this crime than human justice fathoms. It is impossible
for the punishment hanging over me to approach the weight
of my crime. Even should it cost my life, let it be what
you will, I shall accept it from the hands of you judges as
a grace of God.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>The grace of your lord, our dear and blessed king, has
placed a learned advocate at your side. The honorable
Signor Corrado Ezzelino, Master and Doctor of Civil and
Canonical Law, may address the court.</p>

<p class="char">THE ADVOCATE FOR THE DEFENSE.</p>

<p>(<i>Rising.</i>) My exalted, righteous, worthy and honorable
judges, permit me first to speak a word concerning our
brave and honest fellow-citizen, the master-tailor Casare
Pandolfo. We see him here today on the witness bench deeply
bowed down as the result of the abominable crime which
has taken place under his roof. We all of us recognize
the staunchness of his principles; we all&mdash;all of us here
assembled&mdash;know the excellence of his work. I believe
myself able, therefore, to assure Master Pandolfo, in
the name of all of us, that not one of us would think of
associating him, even in the slightest degree, with the
frightful crime which happened under his roof.&mdash;&mdash;Now,
concerning the defendant, whom it is my sad duty to defend:
Apparently, he is an entirely disreputable scamp, more
worthy of our deepest scorn than of being judged in the
normal fashion according to the wise provision of the Roman
code. Permit, O judges, the words of the text, "Thou shalt
not cast thy pearls before swine," to be followed in the
case of this outcast from our dear commonweal. Because of
his unexampled spiritual and moral degeneracy, it would
be impossible for the defendant to know how to appreciate
at its true worth the honor done him by weighing his case
in the scales of justice; therefore, I request you, wise
and honorable judges, in order not to belittle the dignity
of our calling, to let the punishment rest at flogging.
Should punishment by flogging appear inadequate, wise and
honorable judges, possibly punishment by flogging might be
augmented by three days' exposure in the pillory in the
market place of Perugia.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>I grant the floor to the Attorney-General, our worthy
Signor Silvio Andreotti, Doctor of Civil and Canonical Law.</p>

<p class="char">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.</p>

<p>(<i>Who during the whole proceedings has been groaning,
yawning and wriggling about in his seat.</i>) Honorable
judges! As the worthy Signor Corrado Ezzelino has rightly
and forcibly expressed it in his excellent defence, the
defendant is a disreputable scamp, an outcast from our
dear human community, an individual of unexampled moral
degeneracy, in whom I cannot deny there is a certain
mental craftiness, or, to speak more plainly, a certain
peasant's cunning. His own words which he has spoken here
are evidence of this peasant's cunning, as is also the
fact that, with the intention of confusing our power of
judgment, by creating a favorable impression, he has not
attempted to deny his deed. When, however, an individual
from the lowest depths of human degeneracy commits a crime
such as this, which cries to Heaven, then that individual
must be looked upon no longer as a human being, but as
a wild beast; and such a one, as the defendant, himself
cleverly has shown, with the intention of tricking our
judgment, is the most pernicious enemy of our commonwealth,
for the protection of which I and you, you judges, have
been placed here. Such a wild beast, by reason of his
baseness, as well as on account of the danger he is to the
community, deserves that he be destroyed by death and that
his tracks be obliterated from the earth!</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>Defendant Ludovicus, what more have you to say?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>The witnesses are excused!&mdash;&mdash;The court stands adjourned
until the passing of sentence.</p>

<p>(<i>The witnesses, the judges and the Attorney-General leave
the chamber.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>(<i>Beating his head, to Alma, who sits bathed in tears over
the minutes.</i>) Help me, holy Mary, Mother of God! The
booby, with his foolishness, has blubbered all over the
minutes! Not a letter can be read! The leaves are all stuck
together!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Sobbing.</i>) O my God, he is innocent! I know that he is
innocent!</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>Why should it worry you whether he is innocent or guilty?
Is it your head or his head they are going to cut off?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Who stands alone in the middle of the room, aside, but
with emphasis.</i>) My words were, "And so at last the king's
head shall fall under the headsman's axe in the market
place of Perugia!"</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>There, you see how innocent he is!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Who has risen and prays earnestly, with hands folded
across her breast.</i>) Lord God in Heaven, Thou who hast
compassion upon all the poor and miserable, preserve us
from this!</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>See now, you are a brave lad and have your heart in the
right place! I shall certainly not bring you again soon to
a sitting of the court. You must rewrite the whole minutes
from memory at home. You will learn more from that than if
you studied through the whole <i>corpus juris</i>!</p>

<p class="char">THE ADVOCATE FOR THE DEFENSE.</p>

<p>(<i>Who, after the judges have left the chamber, has taken
a package of bread and butter, a flask and a glass from
his robe. Re places the flask and glass in front of him,
and then comes forward, busy with his breakfast.</i>) Now,
Gigi, wasn't that a Ciceronian defence that I made for
you? But what do you know about Cicero! You will allow me
to breakfast, of course. At first, I had the intention of
sprinkling my defence with a little <i>curiculum vitæ</i>, a
moving description of your cattle tending, etc. But, to be
frank, Gigi, I don't believe that either would have helped
you much with those (<i>pointing</i>) dunderheads out there!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>You have my thanks for your pains, worthy Doctor Ezzelino.</p>

<p>(<i>The judges return from the council-chamber and resume
their places.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>(<i>Reading from his notes.</i>) The defendant, Ludovicus,
recently a tailor's apprentice in Perugia, and formerly
employed in the tending of cattle in the village of Baschi,
is accused of the crime of blasphemy against the holy
person of the king, and is found guilty of this crime upon
the evidence of unanimous testimony, as well as by his own
admission. In consideration of his previous good character,
as well as in consideration of his free confession, the
defendant is sentenced to two years' incarceration&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Gives a muffled cry.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>Young fellow, will you hold your tongue while the judge is
speaking!</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;and, furthermore, to ten years' deprivation of all the
rights and honors of citizenship, as well as to banishment
from the city of Perugia for the whole term of his life,
under pain of death in case of his return.</p>

<p class="char">THE CLERK OF THE COURT.</p>

<p>(<i>To Alma.</i>) Write, my lad! Write! This is the most
important of all!</p>

<p class="char">THE PRESIDING JUDGE.</p>

<p>(<i>Continuing his reading.</i>) In view of the important fact
that the defendant has not shown the least trace of regret
for his deed, the sentence provides that he shall spend
his two years' incarceration in the most rigid solitary
confinement.&mdash;&mdash;Given in the name of the king, on the third
day of the month of August, in the year of our Lord one
thousand four hundred and ninety-nine. (<i>Turning to the
guards.</i>) Take away the prisoner! (<i>Rising. To the court.</i>)
I hereby declare to-day's session closed.</p>

With an ivy wreath my brow was dressed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In my locks there sparkled the dew;</span><br />
A pair of falcons above my crest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wove circles in the blue.</span><br />
<br />
From the balcony, in joyous vein,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My mother beckoned and smiled;</span><br />
At e'en thy father will come again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In victor's garb, my child.</span><br />
</p>

<p>(<i>He leans the lute against the wall, sinks down upon
a stool at the back of the cell and plaits a straw
mat.</i>)&mdash;&mdash;I am thirsty.&mdash;&mdash;Is it really so late in the
day?&mdash;&mdash;How time passes here! (<i>He rises and looks
curiously upward through the window.</i>) By the Lord, the
sun is beginning to glide along the south wall of the
tower!&mdash;&mdash;Time for the water jug! (<i>He fetches an earthen
jug from the corner and stands expectantly before the
door.</i>)&mdash;&mdash;He will soon come!&mdash;&mdash;Did I ever enjoy a drink
while I was king as I do the fresh draught of water which I
have received daily at this hour for the last twelfthmonth?
I believe it's a stroke of good fortune that I was never in
jail during my own reign.</p>

<p>(<i>The door opens noisily and a rough voice outside calls,
"Water jug!" The King hastily sets the jug outside the door
and returns inside the cell. The door slams shut, but is
reopened immediately and the jailer enters.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>Zounds and death, Gigi, how did you smash the jug? Silence,
you dog! There's a hole in the jug. It was sound yesterday.
I'll pitch into you so that your face will bleed! You take
me for your servant because lately I haven't watched you
so closely. You'll get it now so that your hair will turn
white! Show your work!</p>

<p>(<i>The King produces the unfinished straw mat.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>That your day's work! You won't get a bit of bread until
you finish five times that amount! (Throwing the mat down
at his feet.) There!&mdash;&mdash;Now I'll inspect your cell. Look
out for yourself! I won't let you out of this hole alive!</p>

<p>(<i>Putting his hands behind him, he goes step by step along
the wall from door to window, examining it from top to
bottom, and turning around now and then at the prisoner,
who stands motionless in the middle of the cell.</i>) What
does that spider web mean up there? The fourth disciplinary
punishment for eight days! (<i>Turning around.</i>) You still
know the seven disciplinary punishments by heart?&mdash;&mdash;Hey,
Gigi?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I know them by heart.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>First disciplinary punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Deprivation of privileges.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>I'll smash that lute of yours to bits; you fritter away
your working hours with it!&mdash;&mdash;Second disciplinary
punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Deprivation of work.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>Then see how you will spend your time! In eight days you
won't be able to stand on your legs!&mdash;&mdash;Third disciplinary
punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Deprivation of a soft bed at nights.&mdash;&mdash;My bed is as hard
as if it were stuffed with pebbles!</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>Silence! This rascal would like to sleep in the hay.
&mdash;&mdash;Fourth disciplinary punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Reduction of rations.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>Bread and water from to-day for eight days!&mdash;&mdash;Do your
hear?!&mdash;&mdash;Fifth disciplinary punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Imprisonment in darkness.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>Sixth disciplinary punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Imprisonment in fetters.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>By that you must understand you are chained all awry, so
that after the first hour all the devils you have in your
body say good-bye to you! Seventh disciplinary punishment?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Flogging.</p>

<p class="char">THE JAILER.</p>

<p>(<i>Having reached the window.</i>) You shall shed your hide
here yet! You, you thief, shall clamber up and down the
Jacob's ladder until you fall dead. (<i>He passes in front
of the King, leaves the cell and shuts the door from the
outside.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Looks after him in surprise. Then quite calmly, with
quiet deliberation, he turns toward the door.</i>) What does
it mean? Where have I made a mistake? For a whole year I
believed that in the course of a year I had educated this
beast into a human being. Suddenly, after all that trouble,
he drops back again into the animal kingdom.&mdash;&mdash;Or did I
dream?&mdash;&mdash;It is impossible entirely that the jug should
have been broken. I drank out of it this morning. He will
break it now outside and then show me the pieces. Will he
let me go thirsty today? Will he let me thirst?&mdash;&mdash;I fear
worse!&mdash;&mdash;At any rate I shall receive him with a look that
will make his eyes sink to the ground. (<i>Bracing himself.</i>)
Help me, kingly majesty, in order that the fellow may
realize his baseness of his own accord!&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Listening.</i>)
He's coming!&mdash;&mdash;A duel without weapons, man against man!</p>

<p>(<i>The door opens noisily. Princess Alma enters, clad as in
the preceding act and carrying a jug with both her hands.
The door closes loudly behind her.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>With the fright of immoderate joy.</i>) Alma?! My
child!&mdash;&mdash;Oh, beastly spite!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>O Father, I cannot embrace you now! I bring you this jug of
wine.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Struggling for breath, with both hands at his breast.</i>)
Oh, satanic cruelty!&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Takes the jug from her and sets
it to one side.</i>) Whence come you, my child? For twelve
months I've thirsted for a sight of you! You are living
yet, you are whole and well. Speak, how is it with you
among miserable mankind?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>We have only a few minutes! At last I have been able to
bribe the jailer, and from now on he will let me visit
you once a week. Tell me quickly how I can lighten your
sufferings.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>My sufferings?&mdash;&mdash;Yes! What a father I am to throw
my child unprotected upon the world! That is my
sorrow!&mdash;&mdash;Otherwise, I thank God daily that He has
separated me from mankind by these six-foot walls, so that
I am safe from them!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>You can see from my appearance, Father, how good people are
to me. I am still in the service of the notary. Only tell
me what I may bring you to strengthen you! What frightful
torments you must have endured here!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>No, no, my child! Do not bring me anything unfamiliar into
this solitude! You don't know how time passes here with
the speed of the wind. In the beginning I scratched seven
hundred and thirty marks on that wall, to have the daily
joy of rubbing one of them out. But soon I had to blot
them out by the week or by the month. And now I see with
dread how quickly they grow less and less, so that the last
will soon be gone and I will have to seek refuge once more
under overhanging rocks and contend with wolves for their
booty!&mdash;&mdash;But do not let my words sadden you! You cannot
guess how the jailer prepared me for your coming!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>I think with silent horror of how fiendishly he will
torment you!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>How you imagine things! To do that he would have to be more
than the weak earthworm he is. No cruelty can keep pace
with my callousness. Do you know, he has shed tears of
compassion here without having heard the least complaint
from me! Who could so degenerate as not to be thankful
when his better self finds unexpected recognition!&mdash;&mdash;He
could not help begrudging me the joy of seeing you again,
my child. But the cowardly anxiety which springs from his
calling is responsible for that. The poor man is so jealous
of the ridiculous little authority vested in him by his
bunch of keys that the kindness he has shown me to-day
makes him afraid of becoming entirely superfluous. But
didn't you suffer need in order to buy the good will of
this rascal?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Speak not of me, Father. Time is passing and I don't know
how I can help you!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Really, I don't know either! Were I an abler man, my fate
might perhaps seem more pitiable to me. Poor as I am, I
only tremble at the moment when those iron doors shall
protect me no longer, when those barred windows shall
prevent them reaching me, when I shall stand again among
people with whom I have no mutual understanding and from
whose activities I am excluded more than ever by the
sentence of the law.&mdash;&mdash;If you only knew how painlessly
this solitude heals the gaping wounds of the soul. The
judge thought he was adding to my punishment when he
sentenced me to solitary confinement. How deeply I have
thanked him that I do not have to live here in association
with other men!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Bursting into tears.</i>) Lord God in Heaven! Then you don't
want to see me here again!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Caressingly.</i>) I repay your sacrifice with discontent and
ill humor. Thoughts become heavy and sluggish when a man
continues talking to himself day in and day out.&mdash;&mdash;Only
this I ask of you; when freedom is restored to me, leave me
to my fate&mdash;not forever, only until I show myself worthy of
your greatness of soul.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Oh nevermore! Do not ask me ever to leave you! It is
impossible that the future should be as bad as the past!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Not for you. I believe that gladly.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Melancholy has mastered you in this gloom. Your proud heart
is almost ready to break. Nothing can be read in your face
of the quiet peace you pretend to feel.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I have not seen my face for a year, but I can imagine how
ugly it has grown. How my looks must wound your feelings!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Oh, do not talk like that, father!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>But you know my imperturbable nature. And now you come in,
the only thing to make my happiness complete. It is only to
reward you richly and splendidly that I would become a king
again.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>I hear the jailer! Tell me how I can lighten your
sufferings!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Sinks down on the stool exhausted, half to himself</i>:)
What do I lack? How frightful this prison would become if
the pleasures of life were admitted here! How can I desire
here a beautiful woman, where I cannot even conjure up a
recollection of beauty! My couch there is shut during the
day. There is no other resting-place, and I lie down there
at night as weary as if I had ploughed an acre. And in the
morning the clanging bell wakes me from dreams more serene
than those I dreamed as a child. (<i>As the door is opened.</i>)
When you see me again, my child, you will hear no more
complaints. You shall feel as happy with me as if you were
outside in your sunny world. Farewell!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Farewell, Father! (<i>She leaves the cell. The door clangs
behind her.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>A whole long year vet!&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He goes toward the wall.</i>) I
will just count the marks again and see how many remain to
be rubbed out.</p>

does not begin until then. This must be the first time you
have made this pilgrimage to the gallows?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>It is only a few moons since we joined the strollers, but,
nevertheless, we have danced at many a witches' sabbath.</p>

<p class="char">THE CIRCUS RIDER.</p>

<p>It seems to me, brother, somewhere you have unlearned
marching. Otherwise you are a robust enough fellow.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Sitting down on a boulder.</i>) My heart beats against my
ribs like a caged bird of prey. The road leads up-hill,
that takes my breath!</p>

<p class="char">THE CIRCUS RIDER.</p>

<p>We have plenty of time.&mdash;&mdash;Your boy, brother, is very much
better on his legs. It's a pity about him! With me he could
learn something more profitable than singing street ballads
to the lute. Everywhere, that's considered not much better
than begging. Let him go with me, brother, if only for half
a year! At any rate, it would not be worse for him than
following in your footsteps, and I'll make a rider out of
him after whom the circus managers will break their necks!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Don't take me for an ass, dear brother; how can you make my
boy succeed as a circus rider when you yourself must trudge
afoot!</p>

<p class="char">THE CIRCUS RIDER.</p>

<p>You are as suspicious as if you had kegs full of gold at
home, while from all appearances you don't remember when
you had warm food last! You won't get anywhere that, way!
To-night at the beggars' fair we shall meet at least half
a dozen circus managers. They gather there to look for
artists to appear with them. Then you will see, you poor
devil, how they will contend for me and how one will outbid
the other! Thank God, I am not so unknown as you, you
gutter singers! And if I get my job again, I shall have
horses enough for your merry boy to break his neck the
first day, if he has the mind!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Tell me, brother, does one find theatre managers too at the
beggars' fair?</p>

<p class="char">THE CIRCUS RIDER.</p>

<p>Theatre managers too, certainly. The theatre managers come
there from all over the country. Where else would they get
their dancers and their clowns! Frankly, brother, it seems
very doubtful to me your getting an engagement. You don't
look as if you could act a farce.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>But there is a higher art, called tragedy!</p>

<p class="char">THE CIRCUS RIDER.</p>

<p>Tragedy, yes, I have heard that name!&mdash;&mdash;I understand
nothing about that art, dear brother. I only know that it
is miserable poor pay.&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To Alma.</i>) Now, my brave lad,
doesn't your mouth water for better fodder?&mdash;&mdash;Do you want
to learn circus riding with me?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>The King, Princess Alma and a Procuress appear on the
scene.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE PROCURESS.</p>

<p>Now, ballad singer, how much will you take for that pretty
boy of yours?&mdash;&mdash;Listen to the pleasant clang of the
goldpieces in my pocket!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Just now a circus rider wanted to buy him from me. Leave me
and my boy in peace! I didn't come to the beggars' fair for
this. Besides, what can you want with my boy!</p>

<p class="char">THE PROCURESS.</p>

<p>Don't think I am so stupid, ballad singer, that I can't see
that your boy is a girl! The sweet child will find a mother
in me, more full of love for her than any one in the wide,
wide world. (<i>To Alma</i>.) Don't tremble so, my pretty little
dove! I won't eat you! When one grows up with such a pretty
figure and such a round, rosy face, with fresh cherry lips
and dark glowing eyes, one sleeps beneath silken covers
and not in the open fields. You will not have to play the
lute with me. Only to be charming. What pleasanter life can
sprightly young blood desire? You will meet ministers of
state and barons at my house; you will only have to chose.
Have you ever been kissed by a real baron? That tastes
better than a tramp's unshaven face!&mdash;&mdash;Look here, ballad
singer! Here are two undipped ducats. The girl belongs to
me! It's a bargain!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Go snick up, you and your gold!&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To Alma.</i>) That fool
woman, in her stupidity, really takes you for a girl in
boy's clothes! Why aren't you? If you were a girl, there
would be no better opportunity than this to rid yourself
of the bristly ballad singer! There is nothing worse than
passing 'round the hat for pennies. Perhaps you have
already gathered pennies thrown you by the compassionate
foster-daughters of this worthy dame?! They always have
a chance of being forced again into the exalted ranks of
burghers' society as worthy members. Our star is not in the
ascendant.</p>

<p class="char">THE PROCURESS.</p>

<p>(<i>To Alma.</i>) Don't allow this vagabond to set your head
whirling, for Heaven's sake, my dear! You don't know how
cozy my house is! The whole day you can amuse yourself with
a band of the liveliest companions. If the ballad singer
won't sell you to me, let's run away from him. Don't be
afraid of him! You will be as safe under my protection as
if you were surrounded by a whole army corps.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Wrenching herself from the Procuress grasp.</i>) I will
speak to him. (<i>Goes from her to the King. With trembling
voice.</i>) Do you remember, my father, why we came to this
beggars' fair?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I know, my child. (<i>He mounts the rock and is received
until dry coughs. Then he speaks in a clear tone, but with
inward emotion.</i>)</p>

<p>
I am the ruler over all this land,<br />
By God anointed, but by no one known!<br />
And should I shriek until the mountains bent<br />
That I am ruler over all this land,<br />
The very birds would chirp a mock at me!<br />
What profit then is this, my kingly thought<br />
When hungering I snap with eager teeth,<br />
As in the winter months the starving beasts?<br />
But not to make a plaint of all my woes<br />
Come I, my folk, to you!<br />

<p>(<i>Anxiously and with embarrassment.</i>) Kind audience! My
specialty on the stage is great and serious tragedy!</p>

<p class="char">THE SPECTATORS.</p>

<p>(<i>Laughing loudly.</i>) Bravo! Bravo!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>With all the force of his soul.</i>) What I have just told
you is to me the dearest, the holiest thing that I have
kept in the depths of my soul until now!</p>

<p class="char">THE SPECTATORS.</p>

<p>(<i>Give vent to a new storm of approval, from out of which
the words can be plainly heard</i>:) A remarkable comedian! An
unusual character actor!</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Who has mounted a rock back of the crowd in order to hear
better.</i>) Finish your monologue, my dear young friend! Or
does your poor brain harbor only these few crumbs?&mdash;&mdash;<i>Si
tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!</i></p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Very well, then! But I ask you from my heart, kind
audience, to give my words the earnest meaning which
belongs to them! How shall I succeed in moving your hearts,
if you do not believe the plaints which come from my mouth!</p>

<p class="char">THE SPECTATORS.</p>

<p>(<i>Laugh and applaud enthusiastically.</i>) What a pose he
assumes!&mdash;&mdash;And such droll grimaces!&mdash;&mdash;Go on with your
farce!</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Hissing.</i>) Children! Children! Nothing is worse for the
actor than applause! If you succeed in making him overvalue
himself, the poor rogue will be capable only of the lowest
kind of trash! <i>Odi profanum vulgus et arceo!</i> (<i>To the
King.</i>) Continue, my son! It seems to me as if your
parodies might amuse my enlightened public!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Seeking by every means to invest his speech with
earnestness.</i>)</p>

<p>
I am the ruler! To your knees with you!<br />
What mean these bursts of mad, indecent mirth!<br />
'Tis my own fault that here, in this my realm,<br />
None knows me more. My sentinels slumber,<br />
My doughty warriors serve another's wage.<br />
I lack that highest earthly might, the gold!<br />
Still, ever yet, was there a rightful king<br />
Who spent his time in counting out his coin?<br />
That task he graciously accords to slaves!<br />
The farthing, soiled with sweat of tradesmen's toil<br />
Was never struck with an intent to smirch<br />
The hands of those anointed of the Lord!<br />

<p>This man is a brilliant satirist! A second Juvenal!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>As before.</i>)</p>

<p>
I am the ruler!&mdash;&mdash;He of you who doubts<br />
Let him stand forth!&mdash;&mdash;I'll prove my claim to him!<br />
I was not wont before to praise myself,<br />
But now the world has robbed me of that pride.<br />
To him who wears a dagger at his hip<br />
I'll teach the art of sinking it with grace<br />
Into his foeman's breast; so that the duel,<br />
From a rude spectacle of sweat and blood,<br />
Becomes as pleasant as an el fen dance<br />
And even death puts on a sweeter garb!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
I am the ruler!&mdash;&mdash;From the herd of barbs<br />
Bring me the wildest of unbroken steeds;<br />
Nor trouble you with saddle nor with bit;<br />
Let him but feel my heels press in his flanks<br />
He'll pant beneath me in the Spanish gait<br />
And from that time be tractable to ride.<br />
I am the ruler! Come unto the feast!<br />
The world is distant with its petty ills,<br />
The evening star illuminates our meal,<br />
From distant arcades mellow songs arise.<br />
The guest may wander through the twilight green<br />
Where, from the shelter of a plashing fall,<br />
The sportive nymphs will lure him with their wiles.<br />
I am the king! Go fetch a maiden here!<br />
Let her be chaste as is the morning dew!<br />
I'll not awake her innocent alarms;<br />
I come a beggar with an empty scrip;<br />
Six steps away from her I'll stand. Warn her<br />
'Gainst wiles of Satan! 'Ere a star grows pale<br />
I'll move, not only body, but her son!<br />
Bring me the truest wife among them all!<br />
She soon shall doubt if loathing or if faith<br />
Is greater pander to the lusts of flesh<br />
And, doubtingly, shall offer me her lips.<br />
I am the king! What child is here as small<br />
In hands and feet, or even in his joints!<br />
With scorn I look upon you as you laugh,<br />
Your feet may jig, your hands may fan the air,<br />
The brains within your skulls are very stale!<br />
So be it!&mdash;&mdash;Will the slimmest maiden here<br />
Venture to dance with me in trial of skill?<br />
She never knew the bloody task of war<br />
And all her joints are quite as small as mine.<br />
</p>

<p>(<i>As nobody offers, to Alma.</i>) Reach me a torch, my child!</p>

<p>(<i>Alma takes a glowing brand from the bonfire and hands it
to the King. Then, standing at the foot of the rock, she
plays a melody on her lute.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The King gracefully and with dignity dances a few steps
of a courtly torch dance, then throws the glowing brand
back into the fire.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE ACTOR.</p>

<p>Down with the barber's assistant. He has no appreciation!
Strike him to earth!</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi!&mdash;&mdash;(<i>To the King, who has
left the rock.</i>) I will engage you as ballet master and
character actor and offer you a hundred soldi a month.</p>

<p class="char">ANOTHER THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Speaking in a falsetto voice.</i>) Hundred soldi, hi, hi,
hi? A hundred soldi will the skinflint give you?&mdash;&mdash;I wave
a hundred and fifty in your face, you rascal! What do you
say, hi, hi, hi?&mdash;&mdash;Will you now or won't you?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>To the First Theatre Manager.</i>) Don't you think, honored
master, that I am rather a tragedian than a comedian?</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>You haven't the least trace of talent as a tragedian; as
character actor, on the contrary, there is no chance of it
going ill with you again in this world. Believe me, my dear
friend, I know these kings. I have eaten dinner with two of
them at once! Your king's monologue is the caricature of a
real king and will be valued as such.</p>

<p class="char">THE SECOND THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Don't let yourself be hoodwinked by this horse dealer, you
rascal! What does he know about comedy! I have studied my
profession at the universities of Rome and Bologna. How
about two hundred soldi, hi, hi, hi?</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Clapping the King on the shoulder.</i>) I'll give you three
hundred soldi, my dear young friend!</p>

<p class="char">THE SECOND THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>I'll give you four hundred soldi, you dirty rogue, hi, hi,
hi!</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Giving the King his purse.</i>) Here is my purse! Put it in
your pocket and keep it as a souvenir of me!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Pocketing the purse.</i>) Will you engage my boy, too?</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Your boy? What has he learned?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>I play Punchinello, honored master.</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Let me see him at once, your Punchinello.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Mounts the rock and speaks in fresh, lively tones.</i>)</p>

<p>
Fortune's pranks are so astounding<br />
That her whims none can foresee;<br />
Sure, I find them so confounding<br />
Smiles nor tears come not to me.<br />
<br />
Heaven itself is scarcely steady,<br />
O'er our heads it's turning yet,<br />
Mankind then had best be ready<br />
For a daily somerset.<br />
<br />
Mischief, when his legs can trip it<br />
When his arms are pliant still<br />
Is so lovable a snippet<br />
That he's sure of your good will!<br />
</p>


<p class="char">THE SPECTATORS.</p>

<p>(<i>Show their approval.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>I'll engage this puppy as the youngest Punchinello in
the business.&mdash;&mdash;We will wander to-night <i>per pedes
Apostulorum</i> to Siena, where my company presents tragedy,
farce and tragic-comedy. From thence to Modena, to
Perugia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Before we reach Perugia, I shall have to break my contract.
I am banished that city under pain of death.</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Under what name did that happen to you, my young friend?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I am called Ludovicus.</p>

<p class="char">THE FIRST THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>I name you Epaminondas Alexandrion! That was the name of
a wonderfully talented comedian who eloped with my wife a
short time ago. <i>Nomen est omen!</i>&mdash;&mdash;Come, my children.
(<i>Leaves with the King and Alma.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">CHORUS.</p>

<p>
Soon the sun will rise in state,<br />
Us to scatter for a year; here and there upon the wind,<br />

<p class="center" style="font-size: 0.8em;">MARKET PLACE AT PERUGIA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<i>In the midst of the market place is a simple stage, from
which a flight of steps leads to the spectators' seats, as
shown in the above plan. A rope separates the auditorium
from the rest of the market place. The back of the stage is
curtained off. To the left, a small stairway leads from the
stage to a space which serves as a dressing room. The King
is kneeling in this space, before a little mirror, making
up his face to resemble a majestic kingly mask. He is
smooth shaven, is in his shirt sleeves and is clad simply,
but richly. Princess Alma sits near him, on an upturned
box, with her left foot over her right knee, tuning her
lute. She wears a tasteful punchinello's dress, all of
white, composed of tights, a close-fitting jacket, trimmed
with fur, and a high pointed hat.</i>)</p></blockquote>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Have you chanced to hear, my child, how the advance sale is
today?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>How can you have any doubts about that? The announcement
that you were to appear sold all the seats for to-day's
performance by sundown yesterday. Indeed, all Perugia knows
already that your art far exceeds anything they saw in
Epaminondas Alexandrion hitherto.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>At the bottom of my soul, I was never pained before that
my laurels increased the fame of another. The assumed name
protected me from too mortifying a contact with humanity.
Even in my most daring dreams I cannot imagine how I would
look today upon a throne. Perhaps, after all, I am fit for
something higher in this world than dishing out, day by
day, the recollections of vanished pomp to the childish
rabble as the copy of real majesty.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>In how happy a mood you have been wherever we have played!
It even seems to me as if you found our stormy success some
slight reward for all the long years of sorrow.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Don't listen to me any longer, my child, or you will lose
your joyousness and appear before the public not as a
punchinello, but as a spectre from the grave!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Of course, here in the market place of Perugia you must
feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="char">A PAGE.</p>

<p>(<i>Enters the dressing room carrying an autograph album
under his arm.</i>) My mistress, the noble spouse of the
honorable Doctor Silvio Andreotti, Attorney General to His
Majesty the King, sends me thither. My mistress desires
the celebrated artist Epaminondas Alexandrion to place his
autograph in this book. My mistress bids me say that the
book contains only the autographs of the greatest men. (<i>He
hands the book and writing materials to the King.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Takes the goose quill and writes, speaking the words
aloud as he does so.</i>) "Only simplicity can fathom wisdom,"
Epaminondas Alexandrion the Second. (<i>Giving back the
album.</i>) Present my respects to your noble mistress, the
spouse of the Attorney General to the King.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit the page.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Making himself ready.</i>) Another wrinkle here, so!
&mdash;&mdash;You, my treasure, indeed, appear to have found
happiness in our present calling.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Yes, father! A thousand times, yes! My heart is full of the
joy of living, since I see my acting received daily with
crowded benches!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>It astonishes me how little our environment affects you,
although you allow all to believe that they are your equals
by birth. You are a lamb among a pack of wolves, each of
which has sworn to protect you, because each one grudges
you to the others. But wolves remain wolves! And if the
lamb does not want to be torn to pieces finally, it must,
sooner or later, become a wolf itself.&mdash;&mdash;But don't listen
to me! I do not understand what evil spirit influences me
today to call down misfortune upon our heads!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Do not believe me capable of such base ingratitude, Father,
as to think that the pleasure I find in my work as a
punchinello prevents me recollecting with joy the noble
pomp in which I passed my childhood!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Rising with forced composure.</i>) At any rate, I am ready
for the very worst!</p>

<p>(<i>As he speaks these words the theatre servants place
two golden seats in front of the first row of benches.
Immediately after, the Theatre Manager rushes into the
dressing room in the greatest excitement.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Alexandrion! Brother! Let me clasp you in my arms! (<i>He
embraces and hisses him.</i>) You pearl of dramatic art! Shall
I make you speechless with pride!&mdash;&mdash;His Majesty the King
is coming to the performance! His Majesty the King of
Umbria and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Filipo! Have
you words?! I have had two golden chairs put in front of
the first row. The moment their Highnesses seat themselves
Punchinello must appear on the stage with a deep bow! So be
ready, children!&mdash;&mdash;And you, Alexandrion, apple of my eye,
bring to light today all the richest treasures hidden in
the depths of your soul! As I (<i>gesture</i>) turn this glove
inside out, so do you turn your inside outside! Let our
royal auditors hear things such as have not been heard in
any theatre since the time of Plautus and of Terence.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Putting on his jacket.</i>) I was just asking myself whether
it might not be better for me to present my royal visitors
with something different from my king's farce; perhaps the
morning dreams of the old tailor's apprentice, or those of
the swineherd. The old tailor's apprentice would give our
guests plenty of material for laughter and that is all they
expect, while the king's farce might hurt their feelings.</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>Ha, ha! You are afraid of being locked up again for <i>lèse
majesté</i>! Nonsense! Give your king's farce! Make it
stronger than you have ever played it! If royalty honors
us, it is because it wants to see the king's farce! What
harm can they do us? <i>Ultra posse nemo tenetur!</i> Well,
what did I prophesy to you when I picked you from the scum
of the land there at the beggars' fair! Today we perform
before crowned heads! <i>Per aspera ad astra!</i>&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>During this scene the spectators' seats have become
filled with an aristocratic public; outside the ropes the
crowd gathers thickly. During the following words the King
dons a royal black beard, puts on his wig, sets the golden
crown on his head and throws a heavy purple mantle across
his shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>My head was to fall beneath the headsman's axe in this
market place if ever I dared return to Perugia without
foreswearing my right to the crown.&mdash;&mdash;Instead of that,
how much have I had to foreswear to tread my native soil
for the second time! The delight of satisfied revenge; the
manly duty of preserving my inheritance for my family; all
the good things of earth which fortune lavished on me in
my cradle, and now even the naked dignity of human nature
which forbids even the slave from offering himself as an
entertainment to those condemned along with him!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>And a thousand voices praise you as an artist the like of
which never spoke to his folk before. How many king's names
are forgotten!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I do not value that! Only a day laborer or a place hunter
can wear with pride the laurels which spring from earthly
misery! But do you know what pride is possible to me in
this existence? Called to an inscrutable trial, I struggle
here as only one of a million beings. But King Nicola, as
king, met death! No one doubts but that he is long beyond
the reach of human humiliation. No one asks him now to
renounce the dignity conferred on him by God. No shadow
disturbs his kingly remembrance! I owe it to this illusion
that I am still alive under God's sun. And until the hour
of my death no storm shall deprive me of this possession,
which, perhaps, I can still dispose of to your advantage!
My sceptre! My orb! (<i>He takes both from the property
chest.</i>) And now&mdash;the&mdash;ki-ki-king's farce! (<i>Seized by a
sudden pain in the heart, he strives painfully for breath.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing to his side.</i>) Jesu, Maria, my father; I can see
how marble white you are through your make-up!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>A shortness of breath!&mdash;&mdash;It is over.&mdash;&mdash;I have been
subject to it since I was in prison&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>King Pietro and Prince Filipo enter the auditorium and
take their places in the golden chairs.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">THE THEATRE MANAGER.</p>

<p>(<i>Calling behind the scenes.</i>) On the stage, Punchinello!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Springing up.</i>) Go! Go! I feel entirely well!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Seizing a fool's bauble, rushes on the stage, bows, and
then declaims in a light, jesting tone.</i>)</p>

<p>
I here appear to herald unto you<br />
The coming of a king, who, verily,<br />
Was never king.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Groom of the bedchamber is my post to him.<br />
I laud him as a demigod, a hero;<br />
Give admiration to his wit; praise his clothes;<br />
My profit great in offices and gifts.<br />
I earnestly desire him length of days;<br />
But, should he die and his successor rule&mdash;&mdash;<br />
I trust God's grace will spare me from that blow!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Why then, obsequiously, with raptured mien<br />
To the newcomer I shall play my rôle,<br />
As is a valet courtier's pious way.<br />
But I must cease, for lo, the King is here!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Enters.</i>) My slumbers have been light throughout the
night.</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Bowing, with crossed arms.</i>) Tour people should be made
to smart for that!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>
My people? Made to suffer? When my mind<br />
Fears I alone should carry all the blame?<br />
What more have I achieved than other men<br />
That I am called to rule it o'er my kind!<br />
Away from off the steps unto my throne!<br />
Slumber forsook my weary eyes last night<br />
Because I, driven by the power of law,<br />
Signed a death warrant when the hour was late!<br />
Avaunt, you worm! And never venture more<br />
Your head within the limits of my wrath!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Turning to the audience.</i>)</p>

<p>
You see, respected auditors, how hard<br />
It may be candidly to make one's way!<br />
In lack of fitting words for my defence,<br />
My plight with resignation I accept.<br />
Dejected is my exit through this door,<br />
But by another I shall soon return.<br />

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>To himself.</i>)</p>

<p>
Half my lifetime I have striven now<br />
To make my eyes more sharp, to clear my wits,<br />
That my dear folk might reap the benefit!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Speaking to the public.</i>)</p>

<p>
Instead of that he might do something wise.<br />
Who gives him thanks? His people whisper low,<br />
His mind is lacking quite in brilliancy,<br />
And his sublime example serves as jest!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>With uplifted hands.</i>)</p>

<p>
Illuminate me with thy light, O God,<br />
That I depart not from thy chosen way,<br />
That good and evil I may quickly learn!<br />
If thy reflected splendor shine from me<br />
The people cannot blindly mock my rule;<br />
Nor inefficiency mislead my steps!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Springing up.</i>)</p>

<p>
I can, however! (<i>She steps upon the stage.</i>)<br />
As you see me now,<br />
I am a woman, decked with all the charms<br />
To fan your kingly thoughts into a blaze!<br />
The flower of innocence remains unplucked<br />
To gratify you with its purity.<br />
Groaning beneath the weight of majesty,<br />
With sublime chastity your wedded bride,<br />
You yet may enter Pleasure's magic path.<br />
Be ruler! Learn to blush as other men,<br />
And do not join the devil's league with death,<br />
In profanation of creation's work.<br />
'Tis fit the hero and the anchorite<br />
Should pray with deep humility to God<br />
To sanctify and make them holy beings.<br />
Before the Lord shall call you to himself<br />
May not some earthly bliss be yours by right;<br />
Do you not fear to come from Egypt Land<br />
Without a good view of the pyramids!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>
And should I riot in luxurious ease,<br />
Who would protect my folk? Who hear their cry?<br />
</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>
That task I willingly would undertake.<br />
Since childhood it has been my constant use<br />
To ride a horse unbroken to the bit,<br />
To crush his wildness in a frenzied gait.<br />
Thy folk shall grow to know no higher law<br />
Than to administer thy joy and gain.<br />
</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>
Depart from out my house, you brazen trull,<br />

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>
Once more the lightning!<br />
My looks do not find favor in his sight!<br />
(<i>Going up to the last step.</i>)<br />
My honored hearers, can you tell me now<br />
Where lies the weakness of this curious king?<br />
Else, from his wrathful gestures, much I fear<br />
Our farce is apt to change to tragedy!<br />
</p>

<p>KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>To Alma.</i>) You must approach him as minister, or
chancellor, and inform him that it is just his wisdom which
brings misery upon the land. If he listens to your words,
he is nothing but a fool; if he does not listen, you can
boldly call him a tyrant!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Bowing.</i>)</p>

<p>
I'll do as you suggest. With all my heart<br />
I thank you for your counsel, gracious lord!<br />
(<i>She mounts the stage once more; to the King.</i>)<br />
With deep dismay, I see Your Majesty's<br />
August rule in danger. From every side<br />
The mob comes streaming to the palace walls.<br />
To me, your loyal chancellor, 'tis clear,<br />
Instead of shooting down this threatening herd,<br />
No better means can now be found to quell<br />
Their spirit than to send them forth to fight<br />
Against the neighboring principalities.<br />
The mob grows weary of the golden hours<br />
And frets against the long continued peace;<br />
It thirsts for blood, like the wild beast it is.<br />
Its drunken lust will crown you conqueror<br />
Amid the corpses fallen from its ranks!<br />
Heaven itself bestows this last respite.<br />
Seize, then, the sword! Else, even in this hour,<br />
Yourself may fall with many deadly wounds.<br />
</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Excellently spoken! (<i>Turning to the Crown Prince.</i>) Do you
remember, my son, to what frightful expedients Bernardo
Ruccellai wanted to force me when I forbade the citizens to
extend the carnival a week? The pretty boy spoke as if he
had been there.</p>

will meet up there.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>
My life!&mdash;&mdash;Take that!&mdash;&mdash;The people's uproar frights<br />
Me not! Before they suffer by my fault,<br />
Why let them in their madness slaughter me!<br />
In time to come, ensanguined with my blood,<br />
They will become a dread unto themselves,<br />
And, worshipful, return to Reason's shrine.<br />
My death will serve its purpose thousand fold!<br />
As payment for your spiteful plan of war,<br />
I here dismiss you as my chancellor.<br />
Be happy you have 'scaped the headsman's axe!<br />
</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Kingly words that I should like to have spoken myself! If
only one could find a better chancellor so easily! (<i>To

Once more my well-laid plan has gone astray!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Before, dear sirs, I yet proceed to show<br />
How I can bring this hero to his knees,<br />
So that he cries beneath my scornful lash,<br />
And whining drags himself unto my feet,<br />
A sorry object, broken to his soul,<br />
Begging that I shall lift him up again<br />
And dampening all the dust about with tears,&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Before I show my skill in this respect,<br />
I ask you to unlace your purses' strings<br />
And to bestow a little of your wealth<br />
With open hands upon my humble self.<br />
</p>

<p>(<i>She takes two white plates and comes down the steps.</i>)</p>

Merely a pause, respected auditors,<br />

<p>I cannot appoint a man who has made his living collecting

prevent me from making a companion of the man whose gifts
have moved me to tears. There is a post vacant close to the
throne, which I have left unfilled until now, because I
did not wish to make a place for folly in a position where
even the greatest amount of wisdom is too small. But you
shall fill this position. You shall be powerless against
the meanest citizen of my state. But your high mental power
shall stand between me and my people, between me and the
royal chancellors; it shall be allowed to expend itself
unpunished upon me and my son. As there on the stage, your
soul stood between the ruler and his dark desires, so shall
it check my innermost self! I appoint you my court fool!

<blockquote><p>(<i>The King in court costume. His office of court fool

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>How strange is life! During many years of hardship of every
description I felt my bodily strength increase daily.
Each sunrise found me brighter in spirits, stronger in
muscle. No mishap caused me to doubt the sturdiness of my
constitution. And since I have been living here in peace
and plenty I am shriveling like an apple in springtime. I
feel life going from me step by step and the doctors agree
in shrugging their shoulders and saying with long faces
that they cannot foresee the outcome.&mdash;&mdash;Did I ever reign
in these halls? Every day since I came here I have asked
myself the same question, and every day it seems more
nonsensical. It is as hard for me to believe as it would
be for me to credit anyone who told me that I had lived on
another planet. King Pietro is the worthiest prince who
ever had a throne, and I am the last person in his realm
who would want to change places with him. That is my last
word each evening, a word which does not make me dream
of the thick prison air, but of the dripping, stormbent,
rustling trees, of the gloomy heaths, of the virgin dew
on the thick grass, of my journeys from place to place on
the stroller's vans, on the tailboards of which I made all
hearts waver between pity and respect.&mdash;&mdash;I have noticed an
unusual cramp in my left arm for the last few days. It is
not gout, it is not the weakness of old age. But before my
failing members give way, I have a work to accomplish. Let
me complete it, O Fate, so that we may part in friendship!
I have cultivated it with all possible care, as the only
thing profitable in my life. Or shall I be the dupe again?
Perhaps, the eager young hearts really do not need my
help? Does egotism make me overestimate by importance in
furthering their union? Who will open my eyes to my true
merits? Blind I came, must I go so? I go and listen! Later
I shall not have to think about the answers. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter King Pietro and Crown Prince Filipo.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>I have made inquiries among the Medici in Florence if they
are willing that a daughter of their house should become
your wife. I have just received word that the Medici,
confident in the permanency of our rule, would welcome such
an alliance.</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Before you did that, my respected father, I had distinctly
told you that I shall never marry any one but Donna Alma,
Alexandrion's daughter!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>In anger.</i>) The daughter of my court fool! You belong
back in the shop whence you came!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Then send me back to the shop, respected father!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt of this maiden's virtues,
the general welfare of the state demands that you wed a
prince's daughter. If you desired to court the daughter
of a citizen of Perugia, I might be able to countenance
your mesalliance without slapping our own origin in the
face. Even then, your choice would be an offense against
the state, which would result in party strife and violence
among the citizens. But if you chose a queen of obscurist
origin for your people, then you show at once that you
undervalue the duties of a prince. Who can tell what
heirs may spring from such a marriage! Instead of looking
forward to your reign with confidence, they will await
it with sullen dread, anxiety and insubordination. Did
I overcome King Nicola and drive him to an early death
that my son should indulge in madness such as cost that
monarch his life and throne?! That is the reason I brought
Alexandrion here, because he has meditated upon just such
serious questions! (<i>Lifting a portière.</i>) Call the fool!
Now he shall show me if his wisdom can withstand the call
of blood! Now he shall show me if he can follow his own
sermons as I do, or if he is only an empty chatterer!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Entering.</i>) What does my dear lord desire?</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>I have been beholden to you for advice in the hours of
the most frightful danger. Had I not followed freely your
advice, so full of watchful and crafty shrewdness, in
difficult situations we might today be under foreign rule.
Now, however, I require of you a sacrifice which, as the
father of your child, you owe the state and our dynasty.
Without restraint I allowed your intelligence to rule
between me and my own blood, never suspecting how soon I
should have to ask you to put it between yourself and your
child. The Prince asks me to give him your daughter for his
wife!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>My child is so far above me that her feet never touch the
ground without the seed of happiness blossoming beneath her
tread.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>I can believe that, but will you order your daughter to
reject every offer of the Prince!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Donna Alma will never obey that order!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Silence!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I can order nothing in this country.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>That is true! But you must obey!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>That is true! But my daughter need not obey!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Enough of your jests! I am sorry I overprized your wisdom.
You understand that your refusal ends your stay here at my
court. I am pained to see your calm deliberation forsake
you at this pass. You are a bad father, Alexandrion, in not
fearing to deprive your child of my good will! In order to
protect myself against the reproach of ingratitude, I shall
have your salary continued&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Thank you, brother, I need your bounty no longer.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Are you out of your senses?!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I see more clearly than you. You no more than I can prevent
the wonderful fulfilment of mighty fate.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Stop your idle babble! I ask you for the last time, will
you obey my order? If not, fear my wrath!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>It is beyond your power as well as mine!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Very well. My son if he wants may run after you. I banish
you and your child for life from this day forth from the
land of Umbria, under pain of death in case you return to
it!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Breaks forth in merry laughter.</i>)</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Holy Virgin, what's the matter with him!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>Disconcerted.</i>) It is the laughter of a madman.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Laughing.</i>) Surely, dear friends, you will permit me to
laugh since I have been paid for being foolish.</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Give us some explanation of what is passing within you,
Alexandrion!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Raising himself to his full height.</i>) Do you know that
you banished me once before, in this very room, from Umbria
under pain of death?!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>It is impossible fur me to remember all the judgments I
have passed!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>You passed your first judgment against King Nicola, and I
am he!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>Shaken.</i>) It was long to be foreseen that he would come
to such an end! (<i>To the King.</i>) Do you want to act a
tragic scene for us out of your former occupation?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I, here before you, am King Nicola!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>With apparent anger.</i>) I have nothing to do with
imposters. Do you really expect to gain your ends by such
thieves' tricks?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>I am King Nicola! I am King Nicola!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>To Filipo.</i>) He has had a stroke! God have mercy on his
soul!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>His poor child! Merciful Heaven, when she hears of it!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>In the greatest astonishment.</i>) Why are you not overcome
with astonishment?&mdash;&mdash;You do not believe me?!&mdash;&mdash;Are you
going to ask me to prove what since my downfall I have kept
secret only by supernatural strength of soul!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>We believe you, Alexandrion! Let me conduct you to your
room. We believe you!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>If only your poor heart would grow quiet!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Anxiously.</i>) No, no, I shall not grow quiet! You do not
trust my words! You doubt my reason!&mdash;&mdash;Almighty God,
where shall I get witnesses to confirm the truth!&mdash;&mdash;Let
my daughter be called! It is high time; I shall not see
the light much longer!&mdash;&mdash;Let my daughter be called! I
am too weak to fetch her myself.&mdash;&mdash;Let my child be
called!&mdash;&mdash;My child!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>I beseech you, Father, do not gratify his wish! The girl
will go crazy from anguish if unprepared she sees him in
his mind's darkness!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Let my child be called! I have nothing to leave her but her
princely ancestry, and now she is about to be cheated of
this last possession through my stupendous folly! Who will
believe the girl when my eyes are closed! Indeed, there is
nothing in me to recall a king! And my pictures, my statues
are destroyed! And even if a picture were found, who would
accept a resemblance as proof of my monstrous statement! A
resemblance in which time has destroyed every trace! Help
me, Heavenly Father, in this anguish worse than death!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Have you quite forgotten, my dear Alexandrion, that King
Nicola is dead?!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Dead?&mdash;&mdash;How kindly you speak because you think I am mad!
Dead?&mdash;&mdash;Where is he buried? I fought against the flood and
escaped to land beyond the city walls. But who will believe
me! Call my child here! She will advise me, as she has done
a hundred thousand times before, with her wisdom.</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>I'll hurry and call your own physician, my respected father!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Call my child! My child!</p>

<p class="char">PRINCESS ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing in.</i>) My father! Almighty God, I heard your
agonizing voice throughout the house!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Am I King Nicola, or am I not?</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>You are King Nicola, my father. Do not worry! What more can
they do to us today?</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>So you too have gone mad or you are a miserable pretender!
They don't believe us! What can we do to prove it to them,
so that I may lay my head on the block and thereby give
you attestation of your birth?! Send to the prison! There
they have the record of the scars on my body. I blasphemed
against the king. "Curse the king!" I cried. I was that
king!&mdash;&mdash;But where is a man with a normal reason who will
believe such adventures! I never thought of that during all
these years! Who would carry documents with him when his
head had been twice forfeited to the executioner! And have
I fathomed the ways of Almighty God more than anyone only
to be considered mad in the end!&mdash;&mdash;But such is life! Such
is life!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>The sight of your sufferings is heartrending, Alexandrion!
But your assertion is ridiculous!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>He is King Nicola!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Think what you say, Donna Alma!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>He is King Nicola!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Search your brain, my dear, clever child, and see if you
cannot find a means of making the truth shine before their
eyes like a ray of sunshine!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA. I will bring a host of witnesses, father, as soon as
the penalty is taken off your head.</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Was not the name of King Nicola's daughter Alma?</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Thousands of children are baptized with princely names!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>Do you hear, my child? An infallible proof! Otherwise, I
shall yet end my unhappy war with the world in a madhouse
and burden your life with the most gruesome of curses, the
curse of the ridiculous!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Lead us to the Urselines!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Can it be possible! The king in his victor's service!
&mdash;&mdash;Speak, my father!&mdash;&mdash;Pardon him!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>Be you who you may, I lift every penalty which may hang
over you.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>And now the proofs, my child! Quick, the proofs! Even if
their testimony is as clear as day, it will do as little
after my death to help the recognition of your birth as my
vain words do now!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>The Mother Superior of the Urselines will testify
(<i>Frightened.</i>) My father! Jesu, Maria, your look! What are
you seeking so helplessly? For God's sake, speak!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>(<i>Who has hurried to aid the King.</i>) Go, Donna Alma! The
strength begins to leave his limbs.</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>(<i>Struggling against death, while Filipo and Alma
support him upon the steps of the throne.</i>) I seek
proofs!&mdash;&mdash;Proofs! Who can prove by his corpse that
he was a king!&mdash;&mdash;It is the last chance!&mdash;&mdash;I am not
mad!&mdash;&mdash;Hurry, my child!&mdash;&mdash;Proofs!&mdash;&mdash;Too late! too
late!&mdash;&mdash;Such is life!</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>(<i>Bending over him, lamenting.</i>) My father! Don't you
hear me? Look me in the eye, my father! What is your hand
seeking? Your child is kneeling beside you!</p>

<p class="char">THE KING.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;I thank you, bu&mdash;but not as a king&mdash;&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;a
man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">ALMA.</p>

<p>Oh, oh, his eyes!&mdash;&mdash;Father! Move your hand! Oh, woe is me,
is there no help? Oh, pity me, he no longer hears my voice!
His cheeks are cold! How can I warm his heart? Your mighty
soul, my father, where is it, that it save you! Don't leave
me alone, my father! Don't leave me alone! Oh, woe is me,
woe is me, he has left me!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>(<i>To himself.</i>) I stand here like an outlaw!</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>Quiet your sorrow, Donna Alma!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>I will seek to make amends for her loss to the best of my
power, if she is willing to become my child through you.</p>

<p class="char">FILIPO.</p>

<p>God bless you for that, my father!</p>

<p class="char">KING PIETRO.</p>

<p>We will give him princely burial; whoever he may be! But
nobody must hear a word of what we three have passed
through here during this hour. History shall never tell of
me that I made a king my court fool!</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
